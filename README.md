# AMAZON-CLONE


I’m excited to share my first mini project — an Amazon Homepage Clone built completely with raw HTML & CSS.
No frameworks, no AI, no JavaScript — just pure fundamentals.

This project helped me understand:
🔹 Structuring webpages with semantic HTML
🔹 Styling layouts using CSS (Flexbox, Grid, spacing, fonts)
🔹 Creating a clean, responsive design
🔹 Re-building a real-world website to sharpen my frontend basics

I learned a lot while building this and it definitely boosted my confidence to take on more advanced projects next. This is just the beginning. 💛

If you have any feedback, suggestions, or project ideas, I’d love to hear them!
More projects coming soon… 🔥

If you want, I can also create:
✔ A shorter version
✔ A more professional version
✔ A more friendly “story style” version
✔ A version with emojis removed
